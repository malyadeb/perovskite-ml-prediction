# perovskite-ml-prediction
Machine learning-based prediction of photovoltaic performance parameters in Perovskite Solar Cells (PSC)

Objective

Predict the following solar cell performance parameters:
PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency)
Voc (Open Circuit Voltage)
Jsc (Short Circuit Current Density)
FF (Fill Factor)
A total of 15 features extracted from material composition and device structure
mlp_perovskite_pce.py: Main script to preprocess data, train the MLP model, and evaluate predictions.
Final Dataset.csv: Input dataset containing features and target variables.
